      <h3>Our Technology Stack</h3>
      <p>
        iNotebook is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
        stack, leveraging the latest web development technologies to deliver a
        seamless user experience. Here's a brief overview of our technology
        stack:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>MongoDB</b>
          <p>
            Our database of choice for storing and managing user data and notes.
            MongoDB's flexible document-based model allows for scalable and
            efficient data storage.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Express.js</b>
          <p>
            We use Express.js, a minimalist web application framework for
            Node.js, to handle server-side logic and routing. Express.js
            simplifies the development of robust and performant web
            applications.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>React</b>
          <p>
            iNotebook's frontend is built with React, a powerful JavaScript
            library for building user interfaces. React's component-based
            architecture enables us to create dynamic and responsive UIs that
            enhance the user experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Node.js</b>
          <p>
            Our backend is powered by Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime
            environment. Node.js enables us to build fast and scalable server
            applications, handling concurrent requests with ease.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
